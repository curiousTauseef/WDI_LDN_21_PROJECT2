# WDI LONDON 21 PROJECT2

##About
Love Underground is a web application I built in Rails 5 for my second project at General Assembly. It is a personal advertisment and dating website inspired by the London Underground which allows users make posts looking for their "missed connections", link them to specific tube stations and message other users. 

This web application uses:

- RESTful routes.
- User authentication.
- Multiple database models.

I had originally built a prototype of this website for a weekend homework assignment in Sinatra, but I felt that I did not have sufficient time to make it as fully-featured. Below is a screenshot of the original sinatra app.

Doing this project in Rails provided me with an opportunity to do this.

##Planning

To plan the project I used a Trello board to organise my workflow.

For design I used balsamiq to sketch my resposive wireframes.
