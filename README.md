# WDI LONDON 21 PROJECT2

##About
Love Underground is a web application I built in Rails 5 for my second project at General Assembly. It is a personal advertisment and dating website inspired by the London Underground which allows users make posts looking for their "missed connections", link them to specific tube stations and message other users. 

This web application uses:

- RESTful routes.
- User authentication.
- Multiple database models.
